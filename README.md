### A privacy first diary of your alcohol consumption

Did you ever consider how much you drink, but don't think that's something you want to share with app makers, advertisers or any one else, really?

If you install this app, it keeps all data to itself. No database except on your local machine. No traffic to the cloud or anywhere else. You can export the data if you like, but you choose to do so, noone else.

**NOTE: If you uninstall the app, the data is lost. Make sure you export your data before doing anything drastic.**
